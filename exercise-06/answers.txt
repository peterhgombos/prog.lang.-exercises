Task 2
======

a)

The parser does not know anything about semantics, and will therefore be able to accept programs that are not valid. A simple example is one with the attempted rebinding of variables. Consider the excerpt:

..
Variable = 1
Variable = 2
..

It is syntactically correct, but semantically incorrect.

b)

A parser is relevant for programming languages so that the syntax can be easily verified and faster compiled or interpreted.
